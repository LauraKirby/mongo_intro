Database - a place to store data

Collection - located within a database and contain documents. 

Document - contain fields and values. are located within a collection. 

Cursor - the address of an object in Mongo

Field - similar to the "property" within an object. 

CRUD - the idea of create, read, update and delete on a specific set of date. 

Relational Database - there are relationships between the sets of data. ex: author: books. 

Non-Relational Database - there are no relationships between the pieces of data. data is stored without order.

CAP Theorem -  states that it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:
1. Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time)
2. Availability (a guarantee that every request receives a response about whether it succeeded or failed)
3. Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures). source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem


Schema - a schema adds a layer of relational organization to your database.
